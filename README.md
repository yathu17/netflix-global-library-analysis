My Conclusion

This analysis reveals that Netflix’s strategy heavily leaned on movies initially but has shifted toward TV shows in recent years, especially in global markets. The United States remains the leading content provider, but international markets like India and the UK are rising contributors. Genres such as dramas and international films resonate strongly with audiences worldwide.
